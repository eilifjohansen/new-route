# New Route
New route is an app which generates points on map, and the user has to reach those points to "score" them.

## The goal of the app
The goal of the app is to make people exercise. We think people will exercise more if they have something they think is funny to do, just look at Pokemon GO. The app will find your position, and then place some points in a user specified radius. This is shown to the user via a Google Maps map. Then the user can go around and “get” the points in the order he/she wants.

## How to use
- Start the app.
- If you start the app for the first time you will come to the start screen. There it is info about the app, click the Settings-button in the upper-right corner of screen (right for title).
- In the settings you will be able to set the radius you will get the points in.
- Click the back-button.
- You will come back to the info screen (or map if you already was in the map). If you come back to info-screen, click the go-button in - down-right corner (a man who runs).
- You will come to the map and your position and see the points.
- Go to the points in which order you want.

## Some other tips
You can at any moment start a new route if you click the button in down-right corner.
If you get lost in the map, click the “Find me”-button. If you get lost in the real world, we can’t help you.
